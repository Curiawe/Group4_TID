Here's what we do when we want to use the icons:

We can add some CSS to it in general so we don't have to specify sizes all the time 
Source: https://github.com/ianmiller347/feather-icons-react

import FeatherIcon from 'feather-icons-react';

All of our icons are:
alert-triangle
calendar
check
chevron-down
chevron-up
chevron-left
chevron-right
clock
corner-left-up (undo)
edit
heart
map-pin
map
menu
plus
save
smile
trash-2
search

Use it as so:
function Welcome(props) {
    return <FeatherIcon icon="smile"/>; 
  }

export default Welcome;
