/**------------ScanCar Palette Colors ------------ */

/**Based on the custom defined colors ReactJS by Sujar Kumar, June 29th 2020

To use the colors by name, you need to...

1..... go into the file you want to use the custom colors in

2..... add the following to the imports:
    import { COLORS } from "src/values/colors.js"
    .. or whatever path you have to the file from where your component file is located

3.... use COLORS.Color000 to call the color you need. Example:
    COLORS.Blue300 
    .. this will grab the string "#4B7DB9" and insert it at that point.
