# Hello and Welcome to Group 4's ScanCar Project.

There is nothing to see yet, but we are hard at work.

## Current work in progress:

### Johanne

sidebar-turned-routing
- ensure that the header still works with the rounting enabled (which it currently does not and we don't know why)     

large-nav-buttons-jodh
- the "3-button interface" from the landing pages, those don't work yet. The flex box does the way I want it to, just the nested components don't. 

sidebar-jodh
- the secondary navigation bar on the side. there are three large things missing: the working display grid, all of the components and all of the functionality ðŸ™ƒ
