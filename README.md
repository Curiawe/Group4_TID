# Hello and Welcome to Group 4's ScanCar Project.

There is nothing to see yet, but we are hard at work.

## Current work in progress:

### Johanne

sidebar-turned-routing
- ensure that the header still works with the rounting enabled (which it currently does not and we don't know why)     

large-nav-buttons-jodh
- the "3-button interface" from the landing pages, those don't work yet. The flex box does the way I want it to, just the nested components don't. 

sidebar-jodh
- the secondary navigation bar on the side. there are three large things missing: the working display grid, all of the components and all of the functionality ðŸ™ƒ

### Marina

cards-marbj
- the frames, texts and the button have successfully be implemented with correct spacing. Currently trying to find the best way to insert the icons and their descriptions (as flexbox vs. as a list). Once successful, actual icons and images will be inserted instead of boxes. 

### Mathilde

booking-component-mgeh
- this component is for the create/change booking page. It is still very much under construction; it still only has very few components, so it is no way near done nor looking the way it should be.
